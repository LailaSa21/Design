                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>The first garden strawberry was grown in Brittany, France, during the late 18th century. Prior to

                    source of the fruit.</p>

                <h2>Description and growth</h2>
                <p>Strawberries are often grouped according to their flowering habit. Traditionally, this has
                    consisted of a division between "June-bearing" strawberries, which bear their fruit in the early
                    summer and "ever-bearing" strawberries, which often bear several crops of fruit throughout the
                    season.</p>
